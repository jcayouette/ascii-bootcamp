=== Evaluating the Documentation Process

The current documentation process at SUSE is showing its age.
The Docbook 5 toolchain alone is unable to keep up with modern documentation expectations without a massive rework.

.Assumptions, Expectations and Generalizations
* Customers expect _accurate_ documentation in a timely manor. _(Updates in minutes not days or months)_.
* Most contributors would prefer to make simple edits and contributions in plain text
* Most contributors do not want to setup a complicated toolchain for contribution (IDE and tools for Docbook XML)
* Most contributors do not want to learn or work with Docbook
* Modernizing the SUSE documentation process will require a move away from Docbook XML as the primary source of input _(Docbook 5 sources converted from Asciidoc will still be used for publishing)_
* Changes should not replace current tooling, instead they will act as a lubricant for enabling contribution and automation.
