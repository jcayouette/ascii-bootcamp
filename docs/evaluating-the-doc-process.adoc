=== Evaluating the Documentation Process

The current documentation process at SUSE is showing its age.
The Docbook 5 toolchain is unable to keep up with modern documentation expectations without a massive rework.

.Assumptions and Expectations
* Customers expect _accurate_ documentation in a timely manor. _(Updates in minutes not days or months)_.
* Modernizing the SUSE documentation process will require a move away from Docbook XML as the primary source of input _(Docbook 5 sources converted from Asciidoc will still be used for publishing)_
* These changes will not replace current tooling, instead they will act as a lubricant for enabling contribution and automation.
