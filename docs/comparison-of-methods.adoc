== Process Comparison

=== Docbook Process Overview

.Docbook Advantages
* Validation against a schema _(Valid nesting and order of elements)_
* Profiling _(Conditional text)_
* Ancient _(Good support can be found online)_
* DocBook is an official W3C standard
* Texts are richly marked up _(Great for computers)_
* Transforms to many outputs
* Open Source _(As in free beer)_

.Docbook Limitations
* The DocBook format is verbose. _(Heaps of need-to-know boilerplate)_
* Generally humans do not like working with XML (There are some exceptional geeks who love it)
* To contribute you will need the Docbook 5 reference http://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.0/docbook.html[Docbook 5: The Definitive Guide]
* Complex to maintain stylesheets and tooling _(XSLT)_
*  A writer must use an IDE, or a ton of manual typing will be required.
* Slow transformation
* Uses java for validation resulting in some nasty errors
