== Project Goals

=== The Vision

To stay relevant I propose the following agile solutions:

.The Desirable Outcome:

* Simple enough for contributors to jump into (**Text based and intuitive**)
* Updated within minutes (Automation via **GitHub/TravisCI/Jenkins**)
* Integrated with either **Jekyll** and **gh-pages** or our own domain
* View modern, **properly versioned** documentation by utilizing GitHub a well known VCS
* SUSE Technical Writers moderate issues and PRs on GitHub

.Project Goals

* Develop conversion from Docbook 5 XML to Asciidoc _(DocbookRx minor devel)_
* Develop conversion from Asciidoctor output to Docbook 5 XML _(Asciidoctor minor devel)_
* Combine SUSE Entities into a maintained single source repository
* Preserve entities from DB5 conversion to Asciidoc, E.G. _( &susemgr; => {SUSE Manager} )_


=== Goal Requirements

.Required Changes:

* Current Docbook 5 XML will be converted to Asciidoc
* Asciidoc is the new source of truth
* Asciidoc can be converted to Docbook5 XML
* Docbook5 XML will only be used for publishing output formats to SUSE.com
* Updated libraries (Asciidoctor Outputs **must validate** against Geekodoc stylesheets (The SUSE Docbook 5 Subset)
