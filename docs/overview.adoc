== Introduction

The current documentation process at SUSE is aging.
The Docbook 5 toolchain is unable to keep up with modern documentation expectations without a massive rework.

.Assumptions and Expectations
* Customers expect _accurate_ documentation in a timely manor. _(Updates in minutes not days or months)_.
* Modernizing the SUSE documentation process will require a move away from Docbook XML as the primary source of input _(Docbook 5 sources converted from Asciidoc will still be used for publishing)_
* These changes will not replace current tooling, instead they will act as a lubricant for enabling contribution and automation.








== Requirements

=== Third Party Tools

The following tools are required to begin development on migrating from the current Docbook 5 process to the Asciidoctor documentation process. This process will be fully functional across SUSE.

* Ruby 2.4.2
* {uri-rubygem-docbookrx-dev}[DocbookRx] (gem: docbookrx) is the prescription (â„ž) you need to get rid of your DocBook pain. This tool converts DocBook XML (hell) to AsciiDoc. Written in Ruby
* {uri-project}/[Asciidoctor] is a _fast_ text processor and publishing toolchain for converting {uri-what-is-asciidoc}[AsciiDoc] content to HTML5, DocBook 5 (or 4.5) and other formats.
Asciidoctor is written in Ruby, packaged as a RubyGem and published to {uri-rubygem-asciidoctor}[RubyGems.org].
Asciidoctor is open source, {uri-repo}[hosted on GitHub] and released under {uri-license}[the MIT license].

Asciidoctor is written in Ruby, packaged as a RubyGem and published to {uri-rubygem}[RubyGems.org].
The gem is also included in several Linux distributions, including Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu.
