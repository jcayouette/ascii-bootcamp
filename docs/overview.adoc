== Overview


=== Introduction

The goal of this guide is to assist SUSE enterprise projects in collaborating with upstream communities and external contributors on documentation. This guide aims to provide documentation guidelines, information on using the new SUSE documentation process and toolchain, and includes guidelines for developing the documentation toolchain.

In addition to guidelines and tips for the SUSE documentation team (both new and veteran members), this guide provides best practices, example templates, and styling recommendations for contributors.
