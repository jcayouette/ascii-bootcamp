== Developers Guide

The following guide will help developers make contributions to the new documentation toolchain

=== Development Requirements

The following tools are required to begin development on migrating from the current Docbook 5 process to the Asciidoctor documentation process. The following sections will cover installation and setup of these requirements.

* Ruby 2.4.2 (You will install and setup rbenv)
* {uri-rubygem-docbookrx-dev}[DocbookRx] This tool converts DocBook XML (hell) to AsciiDoc. Written in Ruby
* {uri-project}/[Asciidoctor] is a _fast_ text processor and publishing toolchain for converting {uri-what-is-asciidoc}[AsciiDoc] content to HTML5, DocBook 5 (or 4.5) and other formats.
Asciidoctor is written in Ruby.


=== Install Ruby on OpenSUSE Leap

The multi-version approach currently used by OpenSUSE for Ruby system libraries can be confusing, especially for new users.  This guide will help you setup a safe environment for developing Ruby applications and will allow you to switch between Ruby versions at will.

You will learn how to setup `rbenv`.
The application rbenv is used to change the global version of Ruby by the local user on the fly, and install different versions of Ruby without affecting system libraries.

==== rbenv Setup Procedure


. Open a terminal and update your system:
+
[source, sh]
----
> sudo zypper update
----

. Install Ruby, rbenv, and (gem::Nokogiri) dependencies:
+
[source, sh]
----
> sudo zypper install libyaml-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel git perl-Text-Iconv
----

. Clone the `rbenv` repository from Github to your home directory:
+
[source, sh]
----
> git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
----

. Add `~/.rbenv/bin` to your `$PATH` so you have access to the rbenv command line utility:
+
[source, sh]
----
> echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
----

. Add `~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init` to your `~/.bashrc` profile to load rbenv automatically:
+
[source, sh]
----
> echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
----

. Pick up the new configuration changes by sourcing `.bashrc`:
+
[source, sh]
----
> source ~/.bashrc
----

. Test if `rbenv` was setup correctly by executing the type command:
+
[source, sh]
----
> type rbenv
rbenv is a function
rbenv ()
{
    local command;
    command="$1";
    if [ "$#" -gt 0 ]; then
        shift;
    fi;
    case "$command" in
        rehash | shell)
            eval "$(rbenv "sh-$command" "$@")"
        ;;
        *)
            command rbenv "$command" "$@"
        ;;
    esac
}
----


==== Add the Installation Plugin

. To properly use Ruby versioning setup the `install` plugin with rbenv:
+
[source, sh]
----
> git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
----

. Make sure the `install` command is available from the rbenv options menu:
+
[source, sh]
----
> rbenv
rbenv 1.1.1-6-g2d7cefe
Usage: rbenv <command> [<args>]

Some useful rbenv commands are:
   commands    List all available rbenv commands
   local       Set or show the local application-specific Ruby version
   global      Set or show the global Ruby version
   shell       Set or show the shell-specific Ruby version
   install     Install a Ruby version using ruby-build
   uninstall   Uninstall a specific Ruby version
   rehash      Rehash rbenv shims (run this after installing executables)
   version     Show the current Ruby version and its origin
   versions    List all Ruby versions available to rbenv
   which       Display the full path to an executable
   whence      List all Ruby versions that contain the given executable

See `rbenv help <command>' for information on a specific command.
For full documentation, see: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#readme
----
+

. You now have `rbenv` setup and can begin begin installing different Ruby versions. The next section will show you how to install and change the global version of Ruby.

==== Installing Ruby with rbenv

. Disable installation of command line documentation to speed up the installation process (optional step):
+
[source, sh]
----
> echo "gem: --no-document" > ~/.gemrc
----

. List available versions of Ruby:
+
[source, sh]
----
> rbenv install -l
----

. Install Ruby 2.4.2:
+
[source, sh]
----
> rbenv install 2.4.2
----
+
[TIP, caption='Tip']
.Using Multiple Versions
You can install other versions of Ruby along side the previous installation safely. These will be stored in:

+
[source, sh]
----
> ~/.rbenv/versions/
2.3.5/ 2.4.2/
----

. Set Ruby 2.4.2 as the global version:
+
[source, sh]
----
> rbenv global 2.4.2
----

. Check the global version of Ruby:
+
[source, sh]
----
> ruby -v
ruby 2.4.2p198 (2017-09-14 revision 59899) [x86_64-linux]
----

==== Installing Nokogiri on OpenSUSE

Nokogiri (é‹¸) is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser. Among Nokogiri's many features is the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.
